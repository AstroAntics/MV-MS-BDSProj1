### Why cognitive modeling is important for psychology and cognitive science

In short, cognitive modeling is the study of modeling the brain and the mind. Psychology is the study of understanding it, and cognitive science links the two, because it combines the mathematical and scientific concepts (brain modeling and other concepts) with the theoretical and physical concepts of understanding. We need cognitive modeling in order to understand psychology and cognitive science better (and not just because it's a prerequisite!).

### Then, in addition to the main branch, create separate branches for each of the two team members, from which you will be merging working code into the main branch.
